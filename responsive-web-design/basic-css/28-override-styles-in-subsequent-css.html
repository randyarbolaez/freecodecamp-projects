<!--

Create an additional CSS class called blue-textthat gives an element the color blue. Make sure it's below your pink-textclass declaration.

Apply the blue-textclass to your h1element in addition to your pink-textclass, and let's see which one wins.

Applying multiple class attributes to a HTML element is done with a space between them like this:

class="class1 class2"

Note: It doesn't matter which order the classes are listed in the HTML element.

However, the order of the classdeclarations in the <style>section are what is important. The second declaration will always take precedence over the first. Because .blue-textis declared second, it overrides the attributes of .pink-text

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }

  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }

  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<h1 class="pink-text blue-text">Hello World!</h1>
