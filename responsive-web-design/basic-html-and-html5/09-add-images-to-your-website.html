<!--

  Let's try to add an image to our website:

Insert an img tag, before the h2 element.

Now set the src attribute so that it points to this url:

https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat

Finally don't forget to give your image an alt text.

 -->

<img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="relaxing-cat" />
